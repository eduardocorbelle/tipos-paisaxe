	The landscape units (microgeochores) were mapped, described, classified,
	documented (written, and by GIS), and processed for a computer-based
	inquiry system. It is possible to assess the suitability of such
	natural landscape units for human activities, the functioning of
	natural balance, the carrying capacity, but also to draft regionalized
	goals of landscape management. This is demonstrated in a case study
	in the physical region of Western Lusatia (924&#xa0;km2), where an
	appropriate new methodology with several steps was developed. The
	use of complex reference units, the assessment of numerous and diverse
	landscape functions, the transformation of natural scientific facts
	to categories of human society (by the evaluation procedure), and
	the elaboration of environmental goals (landscape visions) are essential
	characteristics of a genuine holistic approach in landscape ecology.

	research has tended to focus on the relationship between a single
	value such as landscape aesthetics and a single physical landscape
	component, such as vegetation or water. We spatially intersected
	eight landscape values collected through a regional public participation
	\{GIS\} (PPGIS) process with landscape components and classes from
	the New Zealand Land Classification (NZLC) system. We used chi-square
	residual analysis and correspondence analysis to identify significant

	associate particular values with specific landscape components at
	a regional scale. Greater than expected landscape values were associated
	with urban areas, water features, indigenous landcover, and mountains.
	Fewer than expected landscape values were associated with flatter,
	agricultural landscapes. We discuss the benefits and limitations
	of these methods for landscape assessment in New Zealand, and in
	the absence of \{PPGIS\} data to directly measure landscape values,
	whether landscape components should be used to interpolate values
	for landscape assessment. We urge replication of the method in other

  abstract = {Starting from a concept of the land surface, its definition and subdivision
	from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) is considered. High-resolution
	\{DEMs\} from active remote sensing form a new basis for geomorphological
	work, which is moving on from consideration of whether data are accurate
	enough to how the surface of interest can be defined from an overabundance
	of data. Discussion of the operational definition and delimitation
	of specific landforms of varying degrees of difficulty, from craters
	to mountains, is followed by the applicability of ‘fuzzy’ boundaries.
	Scaling, usually allometric, is shown to be compatible with the scale-specificity
	of many landforms: this is exemplified by glacial cirques and drumlins.
	Classification of a whole land surface is more difficult than extraction
	of specific landforms from it. Well-dissected fluvial landscapes
	pose great challenges for areal analyses. These are tackled by the
	delimitation of homogeneous elementary forms and/or land elements
	in which slope position is considered. The boundaries are mainly
	breaks in gradient or aspect, but may also be in some type of curvature:
	breaks in altitude are rare. Elementary forms or land elements are
	grouped together into functional regions (landforms) such as ‘hill
	sheds’. It may often be useful to recognise fuzziness of membership,
	or core and periphery of a surface object. Plains and etched or scoured
	surfaces defy most of these approaches, and general geomorphometry
	remains the most widely applicable technique. It has been applied
	mainly within arbitrary areas, and to some extent to drainage basins,
	but more experimentation with mountain ranges and other landforms
	or landform regions is needed. Geomorphological mapping is becoming
	more specialised, and its legends are being simplified. Its incorporation
	into geographical information systems (GIS) has required greater
	precision with definitions, and the separation of thematic layers,
	so that it is converging with specific geomorphometry and becoming
	more flexible and more applicable, with a broader range of visualisation
	techniques. },

  abstract = {Abstract Geospatial Pattern Analysis Toolbox (GeoPAT) is a collection
	of \{GRASS\} \{GIS\} modules for carrying out pattern-based geospatial
	analysis of images and other spatial datasets. The need for pattern-based
	analysis arises when images/rasters contain rich spatial information
	either because of their very high resolution or their very large
	spatial extent. Elementary units of pattern-based analysis are scenes
	– patches of surface consisting of a complex arrangement of individual
	pixels (patterns). GeoPAT modules implement popular \{GIS\} algorithms,
	such as query, overlay, and segmentation, to operate on the grid
	of scenes. To achieve these capabilities GeoPAT includes a library
	of scene signatures – compact numerical descriptors of patterns,
	and a library of distance functions – providing numerical means of
	assessing dissimilarity between scenes. Ancillary GeoPAT modules
	use these functions to construct a grid of scenes or to assign signatures
	to individual scenes having regular or irregular geometries. Thus
	GeoPAT combines knowledge retrieval from patterns with mapping tasks
	within a single integrated \{GIS\} environment. GeoPAT is designed
	to identify and analyze complex, highly generalized classes in spatial
	datasets. Examples include distinguishing between different styles
	of urban settlements using \{VHR\} images, delineating different
	landscape types in land cover maps, and mapping physiographic units
	from DEM. The concept of pattern-based spatial analysis is explained
	and the roles of all modules and functions are described. A case
	study example pertaining to delineation of landscape types in a subregion
	of \{NLCD\} is given. Performance evaluation is included to highlight
	GeoPAT's applicability to very large datasets. The GeoPAT toolbox

  abstract = {Abstract We introduce landscape similarity — a numerical measure that
	assesses affinity between two landscapes on the basis of similarity
	between the patterns of their constituent landform elements. Such
	a similarity function provides core technology for a landscape search
	engine — an algorithm that parses the topography of a study area
	and finds all places with landscapes broadly similar to a landscape
	template. A landscape search can yield answers to a query in real
	time, enabling a highly effective means to explore large topographic
	datasets. In turn, a landscape search facilitates auto-mapping of
	physiographic units within a study area. The country of Poland serves
	as a test bed for these novel concepts. The topography of Poland
	is given by a 30&#xa0;m resolution DEM. The geomorphons method is
	applied to this \{DEM\} to classify the topography into ten common
	types of landform elements. A local landscape is represented by a
	square tile cut out of a map of landform elements. A histogram of
	cell-pair features is used to succinctly encode the composition and
	texture of a pattern within a local landscape. The affinity between
	two local landscapes is assessed using the Wave-Hedges similarity
	function applied to the two corresponding histograms. For a landscape
	search the study area is organized into a lattice of local landscapes.
	During the search the algorithm calculates the similarity between
	each local landscape and a given query. Our landscape search for
	Poland is implemented as a GeoWeb application called TerraEx-Pl and
	is available at http://sil.uc.edu/. Given a sample, or a number of
	samples, from a target physiographic unit the landscape search delineates
	this unit using the principles of supervised machine learning. Repeating
	this procedure for all units yields a complete physiographic map.
	The application of this methodology to topographic data of Poland
	results in the delineation of nine physiographic units. The resultant
	map bears a close resemblance to a conventional physiographic map
	of Poland; differences can be attributed to geological and paleogeographical
	input used in drawing the conventional map but not utilized by the
	mapping algorithm. },

  abstract = {Abstract We introduce a novel method for classification and mapping
	of landform elements from a \{DEM\} based on the principle of pattern
	recognition rather than differential geometry. At the core of the
	method is the concept of geomorphon (geomorphologic phonotypes) —
	a simple ternary pattern that serves as an archetype of a particular
	terrain morphology. A finite number of 498 geomorphons constitute
	a comprehensive and exhaustive set of all possible morphological
	terrain types including standard elements of landscape, as well as
	unfamiliar forms rarely found in natural terrestrial surfaces. A
	single scan of a \{DEM\} assigns an appropriate geomorphon to every
	cell in the raster using a procedure that self-adapts to identify
	the most suitable spatial scale at each location. As a result, the
	method classifies landform elements at a range of different spatial
	scales with unprecedented computational efficiency. A general purpose
	geomorphometric map — an interpreted map of topography — is obtained
	by generalizing allgeomorphons to a small number of the most common
	landform elements. Due to the robustness and high computational efficiency
	of the method high resolution geomorphometric maps having continental
	and even global extents can be generated from giga-cell DEMs. Such
	maps are a valuable new resource for both manual and automated geomorphometric
	analyses. In order to demonstrate a practical application of this
	new method, a 30&#xa0;m cell−&#xa0;1 geomorphometric map of the entire
	country of Poland is generated and the features and potential usage
	of this map are briefly discussed. The computer implementation of
	the method is outlined. The code is available in the public domain.

	the context of defining landform units that maximise internal homogeneity
	and external differences, this paper introduces the concept of elementary
	forms (segments, units) defined by constant values of fundamental
	morphometric properties and limited by discontinuities of the properties.
	The basic system of form-defining properties represents altitude
	and its derivatives, constant values of which provide elementary
	forms with various types of homogeneity. Every geometric type of
	elementary form can be characterized by a defining function, which
	is a specific case of the general polynomial fitted function. Various
	types of boundary discontinuity and their connections and transformations
	into other types of morphological unit boundaries are analysed. The
	wealth of types of elementary forms and their boundaries is potentially
	unbounded and thus is sufficient to cover the real variety of landforms.
	Elementary forms in the basic set proposed here have clear potential
	for genetic and dynamic interpretation. A brief worked example documents
	the possibility of analytical computation of various models of ideal
	elementary forms for particular segments of landform. Ideal elementary
	forms can be considered as attractors, to which the affinity of surface
	segments can be measured by multivariate statistical methods. The
	use of the concept of elementary forms in landscape segmentation
	is promising and it could be adapted for elementary segmentation
	of various other spatial fields.},

  abstract = {We have developed a new hierarchical European Landscape Classification
	that can be used as a framework for, e.g., indicator reporting and
	environmental sampling. Landscapes are ecological meaningful units
	where many processes and components interact. And as such, landscapes
	themselves have resulted from long-term interactions of natural abiotic,
	biotic and anthropogenic processes. A good understanding of landscapes
	is essential for its assessment, protection, management and planning.
	An internationally consistent approach is therefore obligatory and
	the production of landscape classifications and associated maps is
	an important tool in this context. Although intuitive maps are available
	there are no consistent quantitative maps of European landscapes.
	In this paper, landscapes are regarded as forming recognizable parts
	of the earth's surface and as showing a characteristic ordering of
	elements. The complex nature of the underlying scientific concepts,
	which sometimes overlap and conflict, requires an objective and consistent
	methodology, as described in the present paper. As there are many
	regional differences in landscape properties, it is crucial to strike
	the right balance between reducing the inherent complexity and maintaining
	an adequate level of detail. Against this background, a European
	Landscape Map (LANMAP) has been produced, making use of available
	segmentation and classification techniques on high-resolution spatial
	data sets. \{LANMAP\} is a landscape classification of Pan-Europe
	with four hierarchical levels; using digital data on climate, altitude,
	parent material and land use as determinant factors; and has 350
	landscape types at the most detailed level. At this level there are
	14,000 mapping units with a minimum mapping unit of 11&#xa0;km2.
	Thus far, \{LANMAP\} is limited to a biophysical approach, since
	there is a lack of consistent and European-wide data on cultural–historical
	factors. This paper describes the conceptual background of LANMAP,
	its methodology and results, and shows its potentials and limitations.

  abstract = {Abstract We introduce a novel method for regionalization of multi-categorical
	landscape or land cover pattern based on the principle of machine
	vision rather than clustering of landscape metrics. Maps of land
	use/land cover (LULC), such as, for example, the \{NLCD\} 2006, show
	spatially varying pattern of \{LULC\} categories. Using an \{LULC\}
	map as an input our method discovers and maps different landscape
	types (LTs), each dominated by a characteristic \{LULC\} pattern
	that reflects varied influence of natural and anthropogenic factors.
	At the core of the method are the concepts of landscape signature
	and landscape dissimilarity adapted from the field of machine vision.
	A two-dimensional histogram of \{LULC\} categories and clump sizes
	is used as a landscape signature and the Jensen-Shannon measure is
	used as landscape dissimilarity. We have also adapted the machine
	vision technique of object-bases image analysis, consisting of segmentation
	and clustering, to find the set of \{LTs\} regions. Such technique
	maximizes spatial contiguity of the regions while also providing
	necessary level of generalization. The method is applied to the study
	area located in the northern part of the U.S. state of Georgia using
	the \{NLCD\} 2006 data. Local landscape is defined over a square,
	3 km × 3 km areal units; there are 8475 such units in the study area.
	Several different computational protocols for regionalization of
	these units are evaluated with the best protocol resulting in a discovery
	and delineation of fifteen LTs. The \{LTs\} are summarized from descriptive
	and quantitative perspective, their landscapes signatures are shown,
	and an example of each landscape is given. Delineated \{LTs\} agree
	well with perceptual patterns seen in the \{NLCD\} map. Non-urban
	\{LTs\} are arranged roughly in stripes running from \{SW\} to \{NE\}
	perpendicular to the regional gradient of elevation. Full resolution
	maps, the data, and our regionalization computer code are available
	at http://sil.uc.edu/downloads.html. },

  abstract = {We have classified the archipelago of Puerto Rico into a set of homogeneous
	and coherent natural landscape units. Such a classification may serve
	as the basic division of the territory for use in research or in
	planning and land management efforts. The landscape units defined
	in this work consist of homogeneous regions—in terms of their structural,
	functional and visual characteristics—which have been shaped by natural
	abiotic factors. Four variables were considered in the analysis:
	elevation, slope, life zones, and geology. The information from these
	variables was processed with non-linear Principal Component Analysis,
	which extracted two components. These components were used in a K-means
	cluster analysis to define nine landscape types (i.e., different
	groupings based on environmental characteristics). Two additional
	measures were obtained from this procedure and used in a subsequent
	analysis: cell membership values and the dissimilarity between landscape
	types. The strength of the grouping procedure was tested by using
	Multiple Discriminant Analysis, which found that 86 percent of the
	objects were correctly classified and that the whole classification
	process was significant. In addition, all variables were found to
	be significant during the classification process. The landscape types,
	the cell membership values, and the dissimilarity measure between
	landscape types were all used to delineate fourteen landscape units
	of the archipelago of Puerto Rico. The main island contains twelve
	units, while the island-municipalities of Vieques and Culebra make
	up two distinct units in themselves. },

  abstract = {Abstract An important level of biodiversity, alongside the diversity
	of genes and species, is the diversity of ecosystems and landscapes.
	In this contribution an indicator system is proposed to measure natural
	diversity (relief, soils, waters), cultural diversity (main land
	use classes, diversity of land use, ecotones, connectivity) and anthropogenic
	impacts (fragmentation, hemeroby, protection). The contribution gives
	an overview of various indicators on landscape diversity and heterogeneity
	currently used in Germany and Europe. Based on these indicators a
	complementary system, is presented. The indicators introduced here
	are derived from regular evaluations of the digital basis landscape
	model (Basic DLM) of the Authoritative Topographic-Cartographic Information
	System (ATKIS), the digital land cover model for Germany (LBM-DE)
	as well as other supplementary data such as the mapping of potential
	natural vegetation. With the proposed indicators it is possible to
	estimate cumulative land-use change and its impact on the environmental
	status and biodiversity, so that existing indicator systems are supplemented
	with meaningful additional information. Investigations have shown
	that indicators on forest fragmentation, hemeroby or ecotones can
	be derived from official geodata. As such geodata is regularly updated,
	trends in indicator values can be quickly identified. Large regional
	differences in the distribution of the proposed indicators have been
	confirmed, thereby revealing deficits and identifying those regions
	with a high potential for biodiversity. The indicators will be successively
	integrated into the web-based land-use monitor (http://www.ioer-monitor.de),
	which is freely available for public use. },
